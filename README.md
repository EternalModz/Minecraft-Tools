This repo just includes some helpful tools for Minecraft.

# World Conversion
Due to many converters not being known to the public, I have decided to create a small list of helpful alternatives to the Universal Minecraft Tool's converter.

**1. JE2BE (Open-Source)**
This tool can be found on the web and it also has an app version.
It supports Java, Bedrock, PS3 & Xbox 360 Conversion.
You can find it here on the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pc9mfx9qcxs?) or on the [Website](https://je2be.app)

**2. Chunker**
This tool allows you to convert Minecraft Java and Bedrock worlds. Its managed by the Hive.
You can access Chunker by going to its [Website](https://chunker.app)

**3. MCC ToolChest**
While yes, this is an old project, it still supports basic world conversion on worlds from before 1.13. It supoorts Java, PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii U.
There is an updated version called MCC ToolChest BE but that one only supports Java and Bedrock. This program does an OK job at converting worlds but at least it works. 
You can download MCC ToolChest from its [Website](https://mcctoolchest.weebly.com/)

**4. MConverter**
I have no experience with this tool but its worth a try. Looks to support Bedrock conversion to other formats.
The tool can be accessed from its [Website](https://mconverter.eu/convert/mcworld/)

**5. Amulet (Open-Source)**
An open-source solution to world conversion for Java and Bedrock. It includes Windows, macOS and Linux support.
You can download it from the [Website](https://www.amuletmc.com/)

**6. Project Lodestone**
THIS TOOL HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED YET AS IT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.
A universal Minecraft world converter which will be open-source. Supporting the PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, Java, Bedrock and more!

This list will be updated soon with more options!
